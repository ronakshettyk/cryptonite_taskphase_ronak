# finding files

## Code:
```bash
cd /
find / -name flag
cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/Documentation/firmware-guide/acpi/dsd/flag
```
## Explanation:
I used cd / command to get into the / directory , then

i used "find / -name flag" to search the entire filesystem for the file named flag

and then executed all the available files to get me the flag
