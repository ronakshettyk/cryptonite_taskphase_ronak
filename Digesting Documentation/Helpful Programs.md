## Code

```bash
/challenge/challenge --help
/challenge/challenge -p
The secret value is: 981
/challenge/challenge -g 981
```
## Explanation

I used the -h option to get help as /challenge/challenge does not have a man page

i used -p to get the secret value , which was 981 for me

then i used -g 981 to get flag.
