  ##Learning From Documentation

    I used the /challenge/challenge command and passed the argument --give flag

    to get the flag
    
  ##Learning complex Usage
    
    I used /challenge/challenge --printfile where the argument to --printfile is the path to the flag
    
    thus i used /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag to get the flag
    
  ##Reading Manuals
    
    I used man challenge command to give the manual of the command passed
    
    there i got to know the directory was /challenge/challenge
    
    and the argument was --nfnxys NUM ,where for me the given number was 018
    
  ##searching Manuals
    
    I used man challenge to get the manual of the argument
    
    then i used /flag to search the flag, then i used n to navigate to the flag i want 
    
    and found the argument to obtain the flag , im my case being (--roh)
    
    i used /challenge/challenge --roh to obtain the flag.
    
  ##Searching For Manuals
    
    I used man man to read the man page of man
    
    in the synopsis i saw the man -k <argument> command that allows you to search 
    
    through the descriptions of all man pages for keywords.
    
    i use man -k challenge to get the randomly generated page
    
    then i use man command to get the manual for the randomly generated page
    
    in the description i find the argument to be used and get the flag.
    
  ##Hel pful Programs
    
    I used the -h option to get help as /challenge/challenge does not have a man page
    
    i used -p to get the secret value , which was 981 for me
    
    then i used -g 981 to get flag.
    
  ##Help for Builtins
    
    I use help command to get the list of shell bulletins 
    
    then i used help challenge to search about the command challenge
    
    here i got the secret key 
    
    and then used challenge --secret <secret key> to get the flag
