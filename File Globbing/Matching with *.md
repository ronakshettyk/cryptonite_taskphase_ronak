# Matching with *

## Code

```bash
cd /ch*
/challenge/run
```
## Explanation

Here i learnt about the one of the globs , i.e '*'  it tries to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern 

except for /, i used cd /ch* as i could only use at most four characters, thus getting into the challenge directory 

and obtaining the flag using /challenge/run and getting the flag.
