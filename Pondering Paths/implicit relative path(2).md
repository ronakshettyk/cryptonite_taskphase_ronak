# implicit relative path

## Code

```bash
cd /challenge
./run
```
## Explanation

here i learnt about a safety feature in linux which stops you to execute 

the program directly from the relative directory as we could accidentally execute programs

in our current directory.

I used cd /challenge to change the directory and then executed

./run command to execute the program from the relative directory
