# implicit relative paths, from /

## Code

```bash
/challenge/run
cd /
challenge/run
```
## Explanation

I learnt about the difference between relative and absolute path,

Relative path does not start with "/"

I ran the /challenge/run command where it showed me the diretory i should be in ,

which was "/", i ran cd to change the directory to the given on

and executed challenge/run to get the flag.
