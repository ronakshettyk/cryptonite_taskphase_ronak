# Listing Processes

## Code

```bash
ps -ef
/challenge/15088-run-30630
```
## Explanation

Listing running processes with the ps command.
Unlikes and likes between ps -ef for details or ps aux.
For this challenge, I need to find a renamed /challenge/run in the process list and relaunch it to get the flag.
