# Multi-word Variables

## Code

```bash
PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
```
## Explanation

Learnt about quoting in the shell to handle spaces in variable assignments.
Spaces are significant, so when I want to set a variable like VAR to a value that includes spaces,
I need to use quotes so it considers it as one token.
