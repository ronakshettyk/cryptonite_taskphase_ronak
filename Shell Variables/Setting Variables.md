# Setting Variables

## Code

```bash
PWN=COLLEGE
```
## Explanation

Learnt how to assign values to variables in the shell using VAR=value without spaces around the =.
I also understood that I use $ only when I want to access the variable's value. 
For this challenge, I need to set the variable PWN to COLLEGE.
